# Advanced-ML

# Step 0

Install all the packages we use. Use the command:
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

# Step 1

Run the DataDownload.py file. This should give you the dataset with all the images.

# Step 2

Run the DataAnalyis.py file. This will create the lazy loader for the dataset amd generate the t-SNE plot. Note: the t-SNE might take a while to generate given the number of images

# Step 3 

To run the models, go to the Models folder, and select one of the model files. Simply running it should suffice. For the SVM go the the Notebooks folder, which is inside Models. Note: Training models will take quite a while
